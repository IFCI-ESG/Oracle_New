CDP requests standardized climate change, water and forest information from some  of the world’s largest listed companies through annual questionnaires sent on behalf  of institutional investors who are endorsed as ‘CDP signatories’. These shareholder  requests for information encourage companies to account for - and be transparent  about - environmental risks.</p>

It can be an effective way  to encourage emitters to reduce their CO2 emissions and thereby limit climate change.  Carbon prices can be in the form of a carbon tax, or form part of carbon emissions  trading, where ‘allowances’ are issued and traded.</p>

                        <p>The Climate Action Tracker is an independent scientific body that tracks decarbonization initiatives by governments and measures them against the goals of the  Paris Agreement. This seeks to limit the rise in global temperatures to well below 2°C  above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to keep the rise to 1.5°C by the end of  this century. </p>

                        <p>The tracker is a collaboration between two German organizations, Climate Analytics and  New Climate Institute, that was founded in 2009 and is based in Berlin. It tracks data  from 36 countries plus the EU, covering about 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions  and about 70% of the world’s population</p>

Only a small  portion of these bonds have actually been labelled as green or climate bonds by their  issuers. (See the Climate Bond Initiative’s website for detailed information) </p>
